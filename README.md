## Basic Form Validation Readme

Today I created a basic login form with form validation. The form includes input fields for email and password. The validation logic checks for empty fields and alerts the user accordingly. Additionally, I experimented with local storage to store the password for a "remember me" feature, although I understand this is not secure for production environments.

### Features Implemented:
- **Form Structure:** Created a simple login form with email and password fields.
- **Icon Integration:** Utilized Boxicons for aesthetic icons within the form.
- **Form Validation:** Implemented basic if-else logic to check for empty fields on form submission.
- **Alert Messages:** Used JavaScript `alert()` to notify users of required fields.
- **Local Storage Usage:** Stored email & password in local storage to experiment with a "remember me" feature.
- **Prevent Default:** Utilized `event.preventDefault()` to validate inputs before form submission.
- **Styling:** Spent significant time styling the form for a visually appealing presentation.
